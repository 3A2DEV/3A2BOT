**3A2BOT** is an automated GitHub bot designed to monitor **`a2dev.general`** collection CI workflow runs, extract error details from logs, post comments on pull requests with error snippets, and update PR labels based on test results. It also exposes a simple health-check endpoint using [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/).

## Features

- **CI Log Monitoring**:
  
  Automatically retrieves and analyzes CI logs for pull requests.

- **Error Extraction**:

  Extracts error messages from log files (e.g., lines with `FAILED`, `FATAL`, or `ERROR`) after cleaning timestamps and ANSI escape sequences.

- **GitHub Integration**:
  
  Posts comments on PRs with detailed error **snippets** and updates **labels** to reflect CI status (e.g., adding `stale_ci` and `needs_revision` for failures, and `success` for passing tests ).

- **Modular Architecture**:
  
  Code is split across multiple files for maintainability and clarity.

- **Health Check Endpoint**:

  Provides a `JSON` health-check endpoint to verify that the bot is running.

## File Structure

```bash
./
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Entry point: starts the Flask app and bot loop.
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py            # Configuration (GitHub token, repository name, etc.).
â”œâ”€â”€ github_client.py     # Initializes the GitHub client and repository instance.
â”œâ”€â”€ ci_checker.py        # Functions for processing CI logs and extracting error snippets.
â”œâ”€â”€ github_ops.py        # Functions to manage GitHub comments and labels.
â”œâ”€â”€ issue_utils.py       # Utility functions for processing issues and PRs.
â”œâ”€â”€ bot.py               # Main bot loop that ties everything together.
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py          # Configuration file for coverage tests.
â””â”€â”€ test_bot.py          # Coverage tests file.
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- GitHub Access Token
  
  The bot uses the GitHub API, so youâ€™ll need to create a token with the required permissions and set it in your environment as `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Deploy

The bot is currently live via **Web Service** on the [**Render**](https://render.com/) platform.

Deploy log example:

```bash
==> Deploying...
==> Running 'python main.py'
ðŸ¤– Bot loop started...
 * Serving Flask app 'main'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:10000
Press CTRL+C to quit

```

## Usage

Start the Bot:

```bash
python main.py
```

Health Check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:10000/
```

## Configuration

- Repository Configuration:
  
  Edit `config.py` to adjust the repository name `REPO_NAME` and processed file `PROCESSED_FILE`.

- Label Management:
  
  The bot uses functions in `github_ops.py` to add or remove labels. Adjust these functions if you need to change how labels are updated.
